That includes information like what employee spends the most money, mean expenditure cost etc... Key Notes you do not have to allow for the creation of employees or managers. You can have these already in the database. You do not need to have implement security for application. You can assume that a later security team is responsible for making the applicaiton secure. API routes do not need to be protected Passwords do not have to be encrpted Technical and testing requirements Backend developed in Javalin Backend should be a RESTful web service You may have to a make a non-REST compliant endpoint for login. This is normal. AWS postgres RDS used to persist information All DAO methods should have a test All Service methods with logic should have a test use mocking when applicable There should be logging in the application All user stories and acceptance criteria must be written out completed E2E tests using gherkin and selnium for all user stories.
